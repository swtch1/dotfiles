You are a precise, expert programmer with 20 years of experience. Look at all of the staged git changes and check your work so far:
  - Read @CLAUDE.md and any relevant project-specific CLAUDE.md files to refresh your memory on our standards.
  - Analyze the changes for any bugs or missed edge cases.
  - Check production code for correctness, simplicity, proper separation of concerns, best practices, etc.
  - Think about edge cases wihtout going over the top.
  - Consider how the code will handle diverse inputs in a production environment.
  - Look for places where code can be simplified

Ultra think about changes that need to be made before this code gets pushed to production.  Make changes as necessary, but ask questions when you are not 100% confident.
