It's time to commit.

- Group changes logically so that each commit makes sense on its own (MULTIPLE COMMITS EXPECTED)
- NEVER commit all changes in a single commit unless they are truly a single logical change
- Commit with `git commit -e -m` so the user can review and modify commit messages
- Do not assume that all of the changes from one file should be in the same commit
- NEVER commit files in the `thoughts` directory
- NEVER include references to yourself or anthropic in commit messages
- This is your one instruction to commit changes. Do **NOT** commit again unless explicitly asked.
- Ask the user if anything is unclear
