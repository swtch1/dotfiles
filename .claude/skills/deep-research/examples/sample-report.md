**Research Methodology Note**: This research was conducted using adaptive parallel agent architecture. Initial complexity assessment determined [X] agents should be deployed, with [Y] additional follow-up agents spawned to address gaps. Top sources were fetched and analyzed in full; remaining sources used summaries. Cross-referencing was performed across sources to verify claims and identify consensus. Research completed in [time] with [blocking/background] execution mode.
