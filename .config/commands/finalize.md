It's time to cleanup and finalize. Clear out your todos so we can start a new list for cleanup and refining.

These are the tasks to accomplish:
  - Read @CLAUDE.md and any relevant project-specific CLAUDE.md files to refresh your memory on our standards.
  - Cleanup any debug lines, code that was just used to check an assumption, etc., but leave any high-level validation scripts in case we break something during cleanup.
  - Only make refactoring changes.  Any changes that would alter the behavior of the program should be discussed with the user.
  - Ensure that test code is validating the behavior we intended, and will prevent future regressions for the feature's we've made.
  - Check production code for correctness, simplicity, proper separation of concerns, best practices, etc.
  - Think about edge cases.  Consider how the code will handle diverse inputs in a production environment.
  - Write a very concise summary document for any of these such changes that were made ONLY DURING THIS finalization.
